      "full": "Werewolves, also known as lycanthropes, are legendary humans capable of transforming into wolves or wolf-human hybrids. The phenomenon has ancient roots in mythology and folklore across cultures, with the most developed traditions emerging from Europe. Historical werewolf trials during the 1500s-1600s paralleled witch hunts, resulting in numerous executions throughout France and Germany. The modern werewolf mythology—including full moon transformation, silver vulnerability, and infectious bite—developed primarily through 19th-20th century literature and film, particularly Universal Pictures' *The Wolf Man* (1941). While no verified werewolf cases exist, the legend connects to deeper themes of human duality, wildness, and the boundary between civilization and nature. The medical term \\\"clinical lycanthropy\\\" describes a rare psychiatric condition where patients believe they transform into animals."
