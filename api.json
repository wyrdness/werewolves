      "full": "Werewolves (lycanthropes) are legendary humans capable of transforming into wolves or wolf-human hybrids. The phenomenon has ancient roots in mythology and folklore across cultures, with the most developed traditions in Europe. Historical werewolf trials (1500s-1600s) paralleled witch hunts, resulting in executions. Modern werewolf mythology includes full moon transformation, silver vulnerability, and infectious bite, though these elements developed primarily through 19th-20th century literature and film. The medical term 'clinical lycanthropy' describes a psychiatric condition where patients believe they transform into animals. While no verified werewolf cases exist, the legend remains powerful in global culture and connects to deeper themes of human duality, wildness, and the boundary between civilization and nature."
